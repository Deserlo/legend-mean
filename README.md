## Legend Martial Arts Academy Website
<p>Senior project team rebuilt a website for a local martial arts studio with added features such as user and admin accounts. </p>
<p>We used NodeJS, Mongo, JQuery and Express as our tech stack. </p>
<p>As part of my learning and development, I am migrating the front-end from jQuery to Angular to make the project a MEAN app.
